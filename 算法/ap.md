## Computational System

### Definition

Computational System: a system that reasons about and acts upon a given domain.

The domain is represented by the internal structures of the system: 
* Data representing entities and relations. 
* Program prescribing data manipulation.

> Notes
>   A program is not a computational system. 
>   A program describes (part of) a computational system. 
>   A running program is a computational system.

## Computational Meta-System 
### Definition 

Computational Meta-System: a computational system that has as domain another computational system (called the Object System). 

A computational meta-system operates on data that represents the computational object-system. 

>Examples 
	A debugger is a computational meta-system. 
	A profiler is a computational meta-system. 
	A (classic) compiler is not a computational meta-system (its domain is a program and not a computational system)
